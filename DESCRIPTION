Description: A multi-objective optimization algorithm for disease sub-type discovery based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. 
   The 'Galgo' framework combines the advantages of clustering algorithms for grouping heterogeneous 'omics' data and the searching properties of 
   genetic algorithms for feature selection. The algorithm search for the  optimal number of clusters determination considering the features that 
   maximize the survival difference between sub-types while keeping cluster consistency high.
