\title{Survival fitness function using the Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) of each group}
\usage{
fitness(OS, clustclass, period)
}
\arguments{
\item{OS}{a \code{survival} object with survival data of the patients evaluated}

\item{clustclass}{a numeric vector with the group label for each patient}

\item{period}{a number representing the period of time to evaluate in the RMST calculation}
}
\value{
The function computes the Harmonic mean of the differences between Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) of consecutive survival curves multiplied by the number of comparisons.
}
\description{
Survival fitness function using the Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) of each group as proposed by \emph{Dehbi & Royston et al. (2017)}.

\examples{
rna_luad<-use_rna_luad()
library(Biobase)
clinical <- pData(rna_luad$TCGA)
OS <- survival::Surv(time=clinical$time,event=clinical$status)
fitness(OS,clustclass= clinical$Wilk.Subtype, 1825)
